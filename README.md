# Roll the Dice Project

## My second game (DOM manipulation and Events fundamentals)

Two persons can play the game:

- Player 1 starts rolling the dice and can hold the results
- Player 2 then starts rolling the dice and saves the results when desired
- The player who first reaches 100 points is the winner
- If the current player gets 1 when rolling the dice, he/she loses the current accumulated score, and the second player is prompted to play

Enjoy :)
